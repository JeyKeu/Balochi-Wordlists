# Balochi Wordlists
This is an ongoing effort to collect Balochi words to create a formal wordlist for Balochi which didn't exist prior.

This repository may contain different word lists extracted from the main wordlist `wordlist.txt` for example:
- `animals.txt` for animals
- `birds.txt` for birds
- `fruit.txt` for fruit
- `vegetables` for vegetables
- `seasons.txt` for season names
- `directions.txt` for direction names
- `days.txt` for the name of the days of the week
